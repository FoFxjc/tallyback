A config document is the parsed form of the application's YAML config file: a
``dict`` whose values are plain YAML data (dicts, lists, strings, numbers, booleans,
``None``). Every document carries an integer ``version``.

``migrate(config)`` upgrades a document to ``CURRENT_VERSION`` by applying each
single-step migration in order, and returns the upgraded document.

* v1 -> v2: ``timeout`` (seconds) was renamed to ``request_timeout``.
